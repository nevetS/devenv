#+Title:Kubernetes Development Cluster
#+Author:Steve Kallestad

This repository contains scripts to build a local kubernetes cluster that can
be used to experiment with Kubernetes.

* Build a cluster
This cluster is going to be used locally, so the tool that will be used is
[[https://kind.sigs.k8s.io][kind]].  Kind is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker
container "nodes".  

You can create a cluster easily with the simple command =kind create cluster=,
but you can also leverage a YAML config file to set appropriate options.
